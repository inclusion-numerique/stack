/**
 * A job represents a task that can be executed asynchronously.
 * It can be triggered by a POST to /api/jobs
 * It could also be triggered by a cli or as a side effect of a mutation.
 *
 * Each job must have an executor defined in jobExecutors.ts
 *
 * A job result should be serializable to JSON and never include sensitive data as it can be logged or stored for audit purposes.
 *
 * It is defined by a name and a payload (that can be optional).
 * The payload should be serializable to JSON for easily being passed as POST data.
 *
 * Add your jobs here.
 * To add a cron trigger, see WebAppStack Jobs definitions.
